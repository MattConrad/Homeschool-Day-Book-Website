<div id="poptallwhite">

<p>When you click on the "Pay Now" button, you will be taken to a new webpage
 hosted by PayPal.  You will not be on the Homeschool Day Book web site any more.</p>
 
<p>You can use this page to pay with either <strong>a regular credit card</strong> or a PayPal account.</p>
 
<p>On this page, you will see the product you are buying (Homeschool Day Book), and 
 a place to enter your billing information (your name, credit card info,
 address, and contact information).</p>

<p>(If you want to use a PayPal account to pay, you can log in instead of entering a credit card.
 Ignore the PayPal log in if you want to use a regular credit card.)</p> 

<p>Once you've entered your billing information, click the "Review Order and Continue" button.
 This will take you to a new page where you can review the details of your purchase and your
 contact information.  Make sure everything is correct, then click "Pay Now".  Your credit
 card will be charged, we'll be notified of your payment, and we'll send your license
 key to unlock Homeschool Day Book for permanent use.</p>

<p>Note that we never see your financial details.  When you enter your credit 
 card, you are doing it on <strong>PayPal's secure website</strong>.  The information
 you enter there is encoded to keep it safe during transmission.  PayPal handles the 
 actual transaction--we just get the results.  Your credit card number
 stays in the hands of the credit card experts.</p>

<p>If you have other questions or concerns about the payment process, please contact us
  at <a href="mailto:info@homeschooldaybook.com">info@homeschooldaybook.com</a>.</p>
