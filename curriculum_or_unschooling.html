                        and this is the only program I felt comfortable buying.  It suits my needs perfectly . . . we tend to
                        unschool, so this is exactly what I needed.</p>

            <p><strong>Homeschool records that fit your unique style:</strong></p>

            <p>Not everyone homeschools the same way.  And the way your family homeschools today may
                not be the exact way you homeschooled yesterday.  Homeschool Day Book is flexible.  Keep
                your homeschool records in the way that suits you.</p>

            <p>If you're following a curriculum, Day Book tracks the time
                you spend easily and accurately.  Move entries from day to day when needed.  Include multiple
                students in the same lesson with no extra work.  Use printable reports to review
                your lesson coverage or to gather information for reporting to others.</p>

            <p>If you're less-structured homeschoolers, you'll like the simplicity of Homeschool Day Book.
                Record only what is important to you, with no unwanted requirements.  Enter all your
                activities for the day on a single screen
                <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="window.open('pop_ss_attendance.html','pop_attendance','scrollbars=no,resizeable=no,statusbar=no,width=820,height=750')">(see the screenshot)</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Of course, the easiest way to find out if Homeschool Day Book is right for you is to try it.
                The trial is free, and includes all the features of the full licensed version (the only restriction is
                a limited number of uses).</p>

            <p>(For unschoolers: If you're interested in the idea of unschooling software or
                unschooled record keeping, take a look at <a href="http://www.leapingfromthebox.com/art/kmg/recordkeeping.html">this
                    article from Karen Gibson</a>, talking about her approach to unschooling-with-record-keeping.)</p>

            <p>The authors of Homeschool Day Book could be called
                "eclectic homeschoolers".  We get a lot of ideas from books and the Internet (especially the Charlotte
                Mason message groups!).  And we're friendly, feel free to
