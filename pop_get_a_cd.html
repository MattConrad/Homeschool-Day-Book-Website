<p>We don't have CDs available (yet!) as a standard option.</p>

<p>For most people, it is faster and easier to download the trial version followed by unlocking to 
 the permanent version.  If you're not sure how to make this work, 
 <a href="mailto:info@homeschooldaybook.com">email us for help.</a></p>
 
<p>If you'd really prefer a CD, though, we can set that up.  Email us at 
 <a href="mailto:info@homeschooldaybook.com">info@homeschooldaybook.com</a> letting us know
 you'd like to buy a CD along with your permanent license.  Be sure to include your mailing address.
 We'll mail you a CD as part of your purchase.
